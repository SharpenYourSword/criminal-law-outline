\section{Rape}

\subsection{Overview}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 32\% of rapes were reported to law enforcement in 1994 and 1995.\footnote{Casebook p. 385.}
    \item 91\% of victims were female.\footnote{Casebook p. 386.} (MPC ยง 213.1 defines rape only as male-against-female.)
    \item 8\% of forcible rapes reported in 1995 turned out to be unfounded.\footnote{Casebook p. 387.}
    \item Susan Estrich: rape law exposes the sexism of the law.
    \item Two frameworks for understanding the crime of rape: (1) a crime of violence and (2) a crime against sexual autonomy.\footnote{Casebook p. 391.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Annette Gordon Reed, \emph{Celia's Case}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A white male landowner bought Celia, a female slave, and treated her as a concubine. She eventually decided to stand up to his advances and ended up killing him by hitting him on the head. She stood trial and was put to death.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{C. Vann Woodward, Review of \emph{Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two white women falsely accused the nine Scottsboro Boys of rape. All were convicted and sentenced. Eventually, all were exonerated.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{NY Times Obituary for Ruth Schut}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A note on the death of one of the two accusers of the Scottsboro Boys. She later recanted her accusations.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Forcible Rape}

\subsubsection{The Force Requirement: \emph{State v. Alston}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Alston and Brown were in a semi-abusive relationship. She broke it off. Then, one day, he coerced her to come to a friend's house. She did not forcibly resist his sexual advances. Later that day, she filed a police complaint.
    \item The trial court convicted the defendant of second degree rape.
    \item The Supreme Court of North Carolina here reasoned that the statutory definition of rape required intercourse to be (1) by force and (2) against the victim's will. The court found no evidence that the victim forcibly resisted. It overturned the conviction.
    \item Susan Estrich: The victim was not forced to engage in sex, but did so against her will. ``To say that there is no `force' in such a situation is to create a gulf between power and force, and to define the latter solely in schoolboy terms.''\footnote{Casebook p. 409}
    \item Vivian Berger: It's not clear that this was actually a rape. Overprotecting women ``risks enfeebling instead of empowering.''\footnote{Casebook p. 410.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\emph{Rusk v. State}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The victim met the defendant at bar. She drove him home. She did not want to go into his apartment, but he took her car keys out of her ignition, and she followed him out of fear. They had sex and she did not resist.
    \item The trial court apparently found that there was insufficient evidence for a trier of fact to prove rape. The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland here affirmed.
    \item Judge Wilner, dissenting:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The court inappropriately substituted its judgement for the jury's.
        \item The court's reasoning requires the victim to either (1) resist, risking physical harm or death, or (2) ``be termed a willing partner.''\footnote{Casebook p. 414.}
        \item The defendant's actions demonstrate the requisite threat of force to prove robbery. Why doesn't it prove rape?
        \item Rape victims who resist are more likely to be injured than those who don't.\footnote{Casebook pp. 415--416.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\emph{State v. Rusk}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Court of Appeals of Maryland agreed with Judge Wilner's dissent (above). The victim's apprehension of fear ``was plainly a question of fact for the jury.'' Remanded for a new trial.
    \item Judge Cole, dissenting: words expressing fear ``do not transform a seducer into a rapist.'' Rape is a crime of violence. The victim ``must resist unless the defendant has objectively manifested his intent to use physical force to accomplish is purpose.''
