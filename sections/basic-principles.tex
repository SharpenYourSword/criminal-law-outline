\section{Basic Principles of Criminal Law}

\subsection{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Henry Hart argues that criminal law is a method with five features:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item It operates by a series of commands (``don't kill or steal'').
        \item A community makes the commands binding.
        \item There are sanctions for disobeying the commands.
        \item The distinction between civil and criminal sanctions is that criminal violations draw a community's moral condemnation.
        \item Violations are punished.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Murray: laws are framed as conditions (``if you do x, then y''---e.g., punishment), emphasizing agency and choice.
    \item \emph{nulla poena sine lege}: no punishment without law authorizing it.

    \item Sources of criminal law:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Codification (statutes, administrative rules, etc.).
        \item Common law (based on the English system, as distinct from a civil-law system).
        \item Case law.
        \item Model Penal Code.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item What distinguishes criminal punishment?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Criminal penalties can restrain personal liberty (but civil penalties don't).
        \item Moral stigma.
        \item Judgment is collective---it isn't about two parties.\footnote{See Schelling, ``Ethics, Law, and the Exercise of Self-Command.''}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Probable cause} is necessary to make an arrest.
    \item \textbf{Indictment} by a grand jury is usually necessary before a case can go to trial.
    \item Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury.
    \item \textbf{Due process clauses} in the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments guarantee persuasion \textbf{beyond a reasonable doubt} (as determined by the factfinder).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Beyond a Reasonable Doubt: \emph{Owens v. State}}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What does it mean to prove something ``beyond a reasonable doubt?''
    \item Driver was found drunk and asleep behind the wheel of a running car in a private driveway. Circumstantial evidence gives equal weight to two interpretations of the facts: either he had just arrived (guilty) or had not yet left (not guilty).
    \item If each interpretation is equally likely, the factfinder could not fairly choose the guilty option beyond a reasonable doubt. But after analyzing the evidence, the court found ``the totality of the circumstances are, in the last analysis, inconsistent with a reasonable hypothesis of innocence.''
    \item The trial court convicted the defendant of driving while intoxicated. The appellate court affirmed.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can you satisfy the burden of proof with only circumstantial evidence?
    \item What is required to meet the reasonable doubt standard?
    \item How should a judge instruct a jury on the definition of ``reasonable doubt''?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Principles of Punishment}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Some types of punishment: prison, fines, community service, shaming.
    \item Two key questions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Who should be punished?
        \item How much punishment is appropriate?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Two predominant (and non-mutuallly-exclusive) theories of punishment: \textbf{retributivism} and \textbf{utilitarianism}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Utilitarianism}

Punishment is justified because it's useful.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Jeremy Bentham: the \textbf{principle of utility} evaluates actions in light of their effect on the happiness of the interested party. Laws aim to augment a community's total happiness.
    \item Kent Greenawalt: ``Since punishment involves pain, it can be justified only if it accomplishes enough good consequences to outweigh this harm.''\footnote{Casebook p. 35.} The consequences of an action determine its morality.
    \item Goals of utilitarian punishment:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item General deterrence (i.e., discourage an action from occuring in a community).
        \item Specific deterrence (i.e., discourage a specific person from doing something).
        \item Incapacitation.
        \item Reform.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Retributivism}

Punishment is justified because criminals deserve it.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Michael Moore: ``the desert of an offender is a sufficient reason to punish him or her.''\footnote{Casebook p. 39}
    \item Immanuel Kant: penal law is a categorical imperative.
    \item James Fitzjames Stephen: \textbf{assaultive retribution} holds that hatred and vengeance in the name of morality are socially beneficial; criminals are ``noxious insects.''\footnote{Casebook p. 42.}
    \item Herbert Morris: \textbf{protective retribution} holds that rules exist to provide collective benefit; they guards against unfair advantage for freeriders; if somebody cheats, punishment evens the score.
    \item Jeffrey G. Murphy \& Jean Hampton: \textbf{victim vindication retribution} wrongdoers implictly place their own value above their victims'; ``retributive punishment is the defeat of the wrongdoer at the hands of the victim.''\footnote{Casebook p. 46.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Justifying Punishment}

\paragraph{Retributive and Utilitarian Justifications for Punishment: \emph{The Queen v. Dudley and Stephens}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dudley, Stephens, Brooks, and Parker were castaways on a boat 1600 miles from the Cape of Good Hope. They quickly ran out of food and water. After twenty days, Dudley and Stephens decided to kill and eat Parker (with Brooks dissenting). All of them ate Parker's body for four days, at which point they were rescued and brought to trial for murder.
    \item The case highlights the differences between retributive and utilitarian theories of justice. Parker was weak and unlikely to have survived the last four days before rescue arrived. Dudley and Stephens likely wouldn't have survived, either. Moreover, Dudley and Stephens had family responsibilities, while Parker was a drifter.
    \item A retributive response would hold that Dudley and Stephens are morally culpable and should be found guilty regardless of the mitigating factors.
    \item A utilitarian response would find them not guilty on the recognition of a net benefit for all parties involved (except Parker, but he would've been dead).

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Sentencing: \emph{People v. Du}}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item The defendant, Soon Ja Du, a 51-year-old woman, owned a liquor store in LA. A 15-year-old girl, Latasha Harlins, in the store put a bottle of orange juice in her backpack. It's not clear whether she intended to pay. A fight ensued, in which Du was injured. As Harlins was leaving, Du pulled out a gun (which had been previously stolen, modified to fire on a hair trigger, and then recovered) and shot Harlins in the back of the head.
    \item Du testified that she did not intend to kill Harlins. The jury rejected this defense, convicting her of voluntary manslaughter.
    \item Du's probation officer concluded ``would be most unlikely to repeat this or any other crime.'' The sentencing court sentenced Du to ten years, but suspended the sentence and placed her on probation. The probation officer wrote, ``it is my opinion that justice is never served when public opinion, prejudice, revenge or unwarranted sympathy are considered by a sentencing court in resolving a case.'' She tested Du's case against seven goals of sentencing:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Protect society.
        \item Punish the defendant.
        \item Encourage the defendant to lead a law-abiding life.
        \item Deter others.
        \item Incapacitation.
        \item Secure restitution for the victim.
        \item Seek uniformity in sentencing.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item None of these reasons was sufficient to justify prison time. The only somewhat convincing motivation for prison time is the strong presumption against probation when guns are involved. But this was an unusual case, she concluded, ``which overcomes the statutory presumption against probation.''
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Proportionality of Punishment}

\subsubsection{General Principles}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Kant: The ``right of retaliation'' (\emph{jus talionis}) is ``the only principle which in regulating a public court...can definitely assign both the quality and the quantity of a just penalty.''\footnote{Casebook p. 70.} Murderers must be punished with death.
    \item Bentham: punishment has four goals:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item General deterrence.
        \item Encourage criminals to choose the lesser of two offenses.
        \item Encourage criminals to do no more mischief than necessary.
        \item Punish cheaply.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item ...and five rules:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item To effectively deter, the value of the punishment must be greater than the value of the offense.
        \item The greater the mischief, the greater the punishment.
        \item Punishment must be sufficient to induce criminals to choose the lesser of two crimes.
        \item Punishment must be adapted to each offense.
        \item Punishment should not be greater than necessary.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Constitutional Principles}

\paragraph{Proportionality and Capital Punishment: \emph{Coker v. Georgia}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The defendant escaped from prison, where he was serving time for multiple violent felonies. He broke into the Carvers' house, tied up Mr. Carver, and kidnapped and raped Mrs. Carver.
    \item The Supreme Court held that the Georgia jury's death sentence violated the Eight Amendment, because rape is a crime ``not involving the taking of life.'' In their dissent, Justices Burger and Rehnquist argued that the Eight Amendment does not prohibit states from taking prior behavior into account. While the death penalty may be disproportionate to the current crime, it can act as an effective deterrent.
    \item A related case, \emph{Kennedy v. Louisiana}, involved the rape of a child. The court narrowly upheld that the death penalty was ``grossly disproportionate'' for rape, but Justice Alito issued a scathing dissent questioning the argument that every murder is more ``morally depraved'' than every rape.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Proportionality and Recidivism: \emph{Ewing v. California}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ewing stole three golf clubs from a pro shop. With multiple prior felony convictions, California's three strikes law required a minimum sentence of 25 years, which Ewing argued violated the Eighth Amendment.
    The Supreme Court's opinion, written by Justice O'Connor, relies on Justice Kennedy's opinion in \emph{Harmelin v. Michigan}, where he laid out a set of principles for determining proportionality:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The primacy of the legislature.
        \item The variety of legitimate penological schemes.
        \item Federalism.
        \item Objectivity.
        \item \textbf{The Eighth Amendment does not require strict proportionality. It only forbids ``grossly disproportionate'' sentences.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The court upheld Ewing's 25-year sentence, arguing that ``Ewing's sentence is justified by the State's public-safety interest in incapacitating and deterring recidivist felons...''\footnote{Casebook p. 85.}
    \item Justice Scalia concurred, but argued that the justification for the sentence has nothing to do with proportionality and everything to do with the idea that ``punishment should reasonably pursue the multiple purposes of the criminal law'' (incapacitation, deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation).
    \item Justice Breyer, dissenting, compared two prior cases, \emph{Rummel} and \emph{Solem}, which both involved major prison sentences for recidivist felons who committed relatively small crimes. In \emph{Solem}, the court found the sentence to be too long, and upheld the sentence in \emph{Rummel}. \emph{Ewing} falls in the ``twilight zone'' between the two. Given that ambiguity, 25 years to life is grossly disproportionate to the crime of shoplifting golf clubs.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Statutory Interpretation}

\subsubsection{The Legality Principle}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Nullem crimen sine lege}: ``no crime without law.'' A person cannot be convicted and punished unless her conduct was defined as criminal.
    \item Three corollaries:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Statutes should be understandable to ordinary people.
        \item Statutes should not delegate policy matters on an ad hoc basis.
        \item \emph{Lenity doctrine}: ambiguous statutes should be interpreted in favor of the accused.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Crime without Law: \emph{Commonwealth v. Mochan}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The defendant repeatedly made lewd phone calls to a married woman.
    \item His conduct was not prohibited by statute, and no precedential case dealt with the same question.
    \item The trial judge found the defendant guilty of ``intending to debauch and corrupt, and further devising and intending to harass, embarrass, and villify.''\footnote{Casebook p. 92--93}.
    \item The appellate court held that solicitation of adultery on its own is not indictable, but it affirmed the conviction on the grounds that the defendant's acts ``injuriously affected public morality.''
    \item The dissent raised an \textbf{institutional competency} issue, arguing that the courts should not preempt the legislature's role in defining new crimes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Statutory Interpretation: \emph{Keeler v. Superior Court}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is an unborn fetus a ``human being'' under the California statutory definition of murder?
    \item A man punched his pregnant ex-wife in the stomach, causing the death of her fetus. He was charged with murder.
    \item The Supreme Court of California examined common law definitions of murder and concluded that it was intended to protect people who had been ``born alive'' but that it did not protect unborn fetuses.
    \item The prosecution argued that medical advances had shifted the definition of a ``viable'' fetus such that an unborn fetus could be considered a ``human being.'' The court held, however, that such a ruling ``would indeed be to rewrite the statute under the guise of construing it.''\footnote{Casebook p. 99.}
    \item The dissent argued a different interpretation of common law in which a ``quickened'' fetus could be considered a human being.
    \item Soon after this case, the state legislature amended the California murder statute to apply to fetuses.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Vagueness and Indefiniteness: \emph{In re Banks}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The defendant was charged under a peeping tom statute that prohibited ``secretly peeping into room occupied by female person.''
    \item The defendant argued the statute was unconstitutional because, if read literally, it would outlaw a wide range of obviously lawful conduct (e.g., looking through a keyhole in your child's bedroom door to make sure she had fallen asleep).
    \item The court reasoned that statutes can be found unconstitutional if they are so indefinite as to fail to give fair notice and fail to ``define a reasonably ascertainable standard of guilt.''\footnote{Casebook p. 105.} In this case, however, the meaning of ``secretly'' is well enough defined to describe invasion of privacy.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Vagueness and Discretion: \emph{City of Chicago v. Morales}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Chicago city council enacted an ordinance prohibiting ``criminal street gang members'' from ``loitering.''
    \item Justice Stevens:
    \item ``...the vagueness that dooms this ordinance is not the product of uncertainty about the normal meaning of `loitering,' but rather about what loitering is covered by the ordinance and what is not.''\footnote{Casebook p. 115.} Under the new statute, ordinary people ``might unwittingly engage in forbidden loitering,'' and law enforcement has too much discretion.
    \item Justice O'Connor, concurring, suggests specific language the legislature might have adopted.
    \item Justice Scalia, dissenting, argues that legislatures are free to regulate against harmless conduct without violating the constitution.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Language: \emph{Muscarello v. United States}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The question was whether the term ``carry'' in a firearm statute included carrying in a car, or whether it was restricted to carrying on the person. Justice Breyer traced the definition of the word in a range of contexts, including a brief empirical reading of news stories, to argue that it includes carrying in a car. Justice Ginsburg dissented with her own range of examples pointing in the opposite direction, and argued that the lenity principle should resolve the ambiguity in favor of the defendant.
\end{enumerate}
